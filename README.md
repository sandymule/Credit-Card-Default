## Project Summary
Credit Card companies in Taiwan enlisted us to provide predictions regarding the default of their clients. In order to build a supervised learning model for classification purposes, demographic data and data regarding the past 6 months of payments were used. A pricing model with a built in cost function was estimated to calibrate the probability of a faulty classification using recall and precision and the economic costs of these errors. In this project report, we provide the analytics and predictions of the defaults. In addition, a Flask web app with D3 visualization is included.
